## 🔄 End-to-End Workflow

1. **Ingestion**  
   Load multiple `.xlsx` files into MySQL using `pandas.to_sql()` in Python.

2. **Logging**  
   Logged ingestion status, error handling, and processing time.

3. **EDA (Jupyter)**  
   - Outlier detection (IQR method)
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Feature engineering: `ord_to_deli`, `year`, `profit_margin`

4. **Dashboard (Power BI)**  
   - Key Metrics: Total Sales, Quantity, AOV, Delivery Days
   - Filters: Year, Segment, Market
   - Charts: Top Profitable Products, Loss-Making Categories, Market-wise Sales

---

## 📈 Key Business Insights

- High discounts negatively impact profit (Corr: -0.85)
- Tables & Bookcases are top loss-making sub-categories
- US, Turkey, Nigeria show heavy profit losses
- Asia-Pacific and Consumer segments dominate sales
- Some customers like **Tamara Chand** and **Raymond Buch** drive high profit
